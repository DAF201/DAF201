The website for backup and such things is still there, but I lost my private key to the server... Which means I cannot update it... I am an idiot

Since I cannot access the server to update, feel free to use the [APIs](https://github.com/DAF201/DAF201/blob/main/APIs.pdf)

Maybe I will make a new one using other tools when I am free in the future.

if you are here because of job application, see below
