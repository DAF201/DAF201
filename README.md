finished "happy sugar life", ~~now watching "Gambling Apocalypse"~~ now being busy for school HW and projects

&& I made all my "early age embarrassing history repos" public 

&& I archived all the repos I am likely not going to have further update on them

&& Very busy currently... dev stopped

&& Just update music playlist (just realized blink-in make not work for all resolutions, but I am not a UI design so I dont know how to fix this sorry)

&& No longer working for NTX, my courses are too busy, time to get back to library

&& 过于真实的幻想露出了天使般的微笑

<!-- 
No, I don't know android or any type of UI dev(that is why I self-taught JS ~actually most of my programming knowledge was self-taught~)

<details><summary>also if any of my co-worker is reading this because of my doc or what...</summary>
  
don't write something like
```javascript
function demo(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        console.log('x = 0')
    } else {
        if (x == 1) {
            console.log('x = 1')
        } else {
            if (x == 2) {
                console.log('x = 2')
            }
        }
    }
}
var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)
demo(number)
```
use if return instead
```javascript
function demo(x) {
    if (x == 0) {
        console.log('x = 0')
        return
    }
    if (x == 1) {
        console.log('x = 1')
        return
    }
    if (x == 2) {
        console.log('x = 2')
        return
    }
}
var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)
demo(number)
```
Once I read 2000+ lines of if else to find a bug summer 2022 hahaha...
