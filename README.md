### tools like repo:

cluster:

~~Scissor and Glue:~~

~~mimicry and mimesis:~~

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improved mimicry_and_mimesis, mimicry_and_mimesis++ lol

transcendence:

  - [transcendence](https://github.com/DAF201/transcendence)
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let you send files through the social media comment sections with a timer.
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time runs out the file will no longer be able to unlock.
  
Blink:

  - [Blink](https://github.com/DAF201/Blink)
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal file host, for file under 50mb.
