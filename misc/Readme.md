<summary>personal complain about UTD</summary>
I don't know how this guy become the Associate Dean of UTD undergraduate, but I can tell even if UTD was a good school a few or even ten-twenty years ago, now it is a piece of shit now.

Base on my personal experience, this guy is the worst instructor I ever met in my 21 years of life(Then I skipped his whole semester classes, I am not a standard good student or equivalent).
